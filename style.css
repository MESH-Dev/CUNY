/* The stylesheet is located in "library/css/style.css", however, it is strongly recommended that you never edit a theme's stylesheet directly. Put your custom code in the "Custom CSS" box in the Customizer's "Custom Code Options" section or use the Child Theme and insert the CSS in the style.css in there. That way you won't lose any changes in future theme updates. Another good way is to use the Custom CSS plugin that comes with Wordpress Jetpack. Good luck! */
